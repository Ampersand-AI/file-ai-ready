# Claude 3.7 Sonnet Integration (Backend Implementation)

This document provides an overview of how Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI is integrated into the trademark/patent application system as a backend service.

## Overview

Claude 3.7 Sonnet provides intelligent, context-aware suggestions throughout the application process, helping users create more effective trademark and patent applications. The integration uses Anthropic's Claude 3.7 API to generate real-time suggestions based on user input.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **ClaudeService**: A service layer that manages communication with Claude's API
   - Located in: `src/services/claude-service.ts`
   - Handles API requests, error handling, and response processing
   - Can toggle between real API calls and simulated responses

2. **API Configuration**: Settings for Claude API integration
   - Located in: `src/config/api-config.ts`
   - Contains API keys, endpoints, and toggle for real vs. simulated mode
   - Provides utility functions for enabling/disabling real API calls

3. **useAISuggestions Hook**: A custom React hook that provides AI suggestions
   - Located in: `src/hooks/use-ai-suggestions.tsx`
   - Manages loading states, caching, and suggestion processing
   - Implements debouncing to prevent excessive API calls

4. **AISuggestion Component**: A reusable UI component for displaying AI suggestions
   - Located in: `src/components/ui/ai-suggestion.tsx`
   - Displays suggestions with apply functionality
   - Shows API mode indicator only in development environments

5. **APIToggle Component**: Developer tool for toggling between real and simulated responses
   - Located in: `src/components/ui/api-toggle.tsx`
   - Only appears in development environments
   - Allows testing with real API calls without changing code

### Integration Points

AI suggestions are integrated into multiple parts of the application:

#### Trademark Application
- **Basic Info**: Provides suggestions for trademark names and owner information
- **Goods & Services**: Helps refine business descriptions and goods/services classifications
- **Usage Evidence**: Suggests appropriate specimens and documentation

#### Patent Application
- **Basic Info**: Optimizes patent titles and enhances invention descriptions
- **Claims**: Generates and improves patent claims with proper structure

## Suggestion Types

The system offers several types of intelligent suggestions:

1. **Improvement Suggestions**: Help users refine and enhance their entries
2. **Verification Tasks**: Prompt users to check important elements (added to task list)
3. **Considerations**: Additional factors to take into account during application
4. **Auto-completions**: Smart text additions that can be directly applied

## Production Setup

To use the actual Claude 3.7 Sonnet API in production:

1. Obtain an API key from Anthropic
2. Add the key to the API configuration in `src/config/api-config.ts`
3. Set `USE_REAL_API` to `true` in the configuration
4. Update API parameters as needed based on Anthropic's latest documentation

## Development vs. Production Mode

The system has two operational modes:

1. **Simulation Mode** (default): Uses pre-defined responses that simulate Claude's capabilities
   - No API key required
   - Instant responses with no external API calls
   - Useful for development and testing

2. **Real API Mode**: Makes actual API calls to Claude 3.7 Sonnet
   - Requires a valid API key
   - Provides more intelligent, context-aware responses
   - Should be used in production

To toggle between modes:
- In development: Use the API Toggle component visible in dev environments
- In production: Set `USE_REAL_API` in configuration based on environment variables

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

1. API errors are caught and presented with user-friendly messages
2. Network failures are detected and reported
3. API key validation prevents unnecessary API calls with invalid keys
4. Race conditions are handled for typing-based suggestions

## Security Considerations

1. API keys should be stored in environment variables, never in code
2. In production, API calls should be proxied through a backend service
3. User data sent to Claude should be minimized to what's necessary
4. Response content should be sanitized before displaying to users

## Performance Considerations

- The hook implements debouncing (600ms) to prevent excessive API calls
- Suggestions are generated only when input exceeds the minimum length
- API calls are cancelled when component unmounts or input changes rapidly

## Example Usage

```tsx
<AISuggestion 
  fieldType="trademark-name" 
  inputValue={formData.markName}
  description="AI suggests:"
  onUseSuggestion={handleUseSuggestion}
  showUseButtons={true}
/>
```

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced suggestion analytics
- Personalized suggestion models based on user behavior
- Integration with other application stages (e.g., filing, revision)
- Fine-tuning models for IP-specific domain knowledge
